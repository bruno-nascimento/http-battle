# HTTP Battle

Launch the heat seekers! Release the swarm! Charge!

*HTTP Battle* is a simple *NodeJS* _script_ used to test (and compare) some web servers in a simple way.

In this repo you will find the script that is used to launch the tests and a `docker-compose.yml` example of how you could play with the runtime params.

We have used this script to battle test 3 NodeJS and 2 Java and the results were, so far:

1. [Java] SPARK 9159
2. [Node] NET 8771
3. [Node] HTTP 8481
4. [Node] FASTIFY 8461
5. [Java] NIO 8329
